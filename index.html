          But it's not just Google. The problem is that sites
          have taken on an extractive revenue model because it allows
          them to survive and thrive in the current landscape.
        </p>

        <p>
          The internet's highest value is its ability to curate and filter
          community knowledge, but it has become so bloated, filled with
          scripts, trackers, and ads that it is absolutely miserable to use. The
          best or most relevant results to your search query are obscured by
          thousands of sites that have SEO'd (search engine optimized) to steal
          your attention and bait you into watching ads.
        </p>

            Here is a great 3rd party demonstration of the problem.

      Our core philosophy is that the highest value of a community will arise when
      members produce content purely to share, rather than to profit. Hence the
      <i>demonetized</i>. Our ultimate goal is to spread awareness of the
      problem, and compile a list of resources to provide people with a better
      way.

		This site is very much so a work in progress. It will likely stay that way until the end of time.
		So far <a href="https://vladimir.prelovac.com/">Vladimir Prelovac</a> has taken this idea
		much farther, beyond my technical ability. He is responsible for both
		<a href="https://kagi.com/">kagi.com</a> and <a href="https://teclis.com/">teclis.com</a>,
		which are two amazing solutions I have found so far for the demonetized web.

    <h1>Resources</h1>
	<h3>Indexing Services</h3>
    <dl>
      <dt><a href="https://kagi.com/">Kagi.com</a></dt>
      <dd>
       A premium search engine for $10/month. "Kagi Search is a quick, user-centric, 100%
        privacy-respecting search engine with results augmented by
        non-commercial indexes and personalized searches." Basically a <a href="https://hammer.lol/">hammer.lol</a>
      </dd>
      <dt><a href="https://teclis.com/">Teclis.com</a></dt>
      <dd>
        Non commercial web search. Counts uBlock blocked requests, and blocks
        pages that make too many requests. Basically what this site was supposed to be, 
		but done by someone with the technical know-how to make a web crawler and an indexing service.
